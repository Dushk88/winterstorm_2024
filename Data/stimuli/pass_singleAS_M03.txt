the image of john chapman and his heap of apple seeds riding together down the ohio has stayed with me since i first came across it a few years ago in an out of print biography the scene for me has the resonance of myth, a myth about how plants and people learned to use each other each doing for the other things they could not do for themselves in the bargain changing each other and improving their common lot henry david thoreau once wrote that it is remarkable how closely the history of the apple tree is connected with that of man and much of the american chapter of that story can be teased out of chapman story its the story of how pioneers like him helped domesticate the frontier by seeding it with old world plants exotics we are apt to call these species today in disparagement yet without them the american wilderness might never have become a home what did the apple get in return a golden age untold new varieties and half a world of new habitat of the man lounging in the two hulled canoe robert price his biographer wrote that he had the thick bark of queerness on him indeed a man with no fixed address his entire adult life
